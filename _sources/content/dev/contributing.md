# Contributing

Thanks so much for considering contributing to `plausible`: with thousands of amazing Open Source projects out there, it's amazing that you want to help us reach our goal! 

If you'd like to contribute please go to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/NatalieThurlby/plausible/) and either comment on an existing issue, or create a new issue before you start working on your contribution. 
This help us to communicate so that we can maximise everyone's contributions, for example it helps us to make sure that no one else is already working on the same thing.

We are in the process of writing a {ref}`developer guide<developer-guide>` to help people get started - the docs are a really helpful place for people to make contributions.

If it's your first time contributing to Open Source, and you'd like a bit more hands-on help, we're happy to walk you through - please [email Natalie](mailto:natalie.thurlby@bristol.ac.uk).
