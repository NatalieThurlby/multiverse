# Development

In this section, you'll find information related to the development of `plausible`, for example the {ref}`roadmap<dev-roadmap>` (what we're planning next), the {ref}`changelog<dev-changelog>` (what we've done so far), how to {ref}`contribute<contributing>`.

## Development philosophy

We're developing `plausible` in adherence to Research Software Engineering best practices wherever we can, for example:
- Aiming for a high percentage of code covered by testing, with testing being carried out automatically (Continuous Integration), to create more reliable code.
- Choosing features through what is useful to users, and creating thorough documentation and tutorials, to create more useful and usable code.
- Using [semantic versioning](semvar.org) for meaningful software version numbers.
