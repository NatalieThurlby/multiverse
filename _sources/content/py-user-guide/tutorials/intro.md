# Python `plausible` Tutorials

The development of `plausible` is being undertaken with a [tutorial-driven development](https://chryswoods.github.io/blog/return_of_the_king/#tutorial-driven-development) philosophy, meaning that we develop a tutorial for each feature as it's developed. 
Features aren't considered to exist in `plausible` unless they exist in a tutorial.
