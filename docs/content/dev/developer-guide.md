# Developer guide

[//]: # (TODO: Write: setup computer, workflow, testing)

## What the developer guide is __not__
The point of the developer guide is to support you in *how* to work on `plausible`, not *what* to work on. 
If you'd like to help, but you don't know what to work on, head to GitHub and look for issues tagged ["good first issue"](https://github.com/NatalieThurlby/plausible/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [email Natalie](mailto:natalie.thurlby@bristol.ac.uk).
